### Project Overview

The dataset contains Bitcoin Historical Data.
Bitcoin data at 1-min intervals from select exchanges, for the time period of Jan 2012 to December March 2021, with a minute to minute updates of OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close), Volume in BTC and indicated currency, and weighted bitcoin price. Timestamps are in Unix time. Timestamps without any trades or activity have their data fields filled with NaNs. If a timestamp is missing, or if there are jumps, this may be because the exchange (or its API) was down, the exchange (or its API) did not exist, or some other unforeseen technical error in data reporting or gathering. 
### Tools 
- Microsoft Excel - Data Validation
- Power Query-- Data Cleaning
- Microsoft Power BI - Visualizations

### Data Cleaning
In the data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading
2. Data Validation
3. Handling missing Values
4. Handling Nan Values
5. Unix Time conversion to date timestamps
6. Data Cleaning
### Insights
1. Bitcoin value by year and Month.
2. Bitcoin volume by year and Month.
